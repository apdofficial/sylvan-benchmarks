c The problem line for weighted projected CNF formulas specifies the numbers of variables and clauses.
c A weighted projected CNF formula with 6 vars and 5 clauses:
p cnf 6 5

c The Sum-var line lists Sum-vars (and optionally ends with "0").
c Sum-vars X = {z1, z3, z5}:
c p show 1 3 5 0
c If the Sum-var line is omitted, then X is empty.

c For each Sum-var z, there are typically weight lines for literals z and -z.
c A weight line specifies a literal and its weight (and optionally ends with "0").
c Weight lines for Sum-vars X = {z1, z3, z5}:
c p weight  1 0.1
c p weight -1 0.9
c p weight  3 1
c p weight -3 1
c p weight  5 1.5
c p weight -5 2.5
c If z has a weight line but -z does not, then weight(-z) = 1 - weight(z).
c If -z has a weight line but z does not, then weight(z) = 1 - weight(-z).
c If neither z nor -z has a weight line, then weight(z) = weight(-z) = 1.

c There are typically no weight lines for Exist-vars Y = {z2, z4, z6}.

c Each clause line lists literals and ends with "0".

c Clause 1 contains literals {z2, -z4}:
2 -4 0

c Clause 2:
1 6 0

c Clause 3:
1 0

c Clause 4:
3 5 0

c Clause 5:
-3 -5 0
