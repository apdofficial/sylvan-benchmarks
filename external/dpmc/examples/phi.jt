c Each comment line starts with "c".
c This file represents a graded join tree for the projected CNF formula `./phi.cnf`.

c The problem line for join trees for CNF formulas is "p jt $vars $clauses $nodes".
c A 10-node join tree of a CNF formula with 6 variables and 5 clauses:
p jt 6 5 10

c Each leaf node corresponds to a unique CNF clause.
c Leaf nodes are implicitly numbered {1,..., $clauses} (in this case, {n1,..., n5}).

c Each internal node line is "$index $children e $elimVars".
c $index identifies this node (an integer in {clauses + 1,..., $nodes}).
c $children is a list of indices of child nodes (subset of {1,..., $index - 1}).
c $elimVars is a list of variables to be eliminated/projected (subset of {1,..., $vars}).

c Internal node n6 has child n1 and eliminates variables {z2, z4}:
6 1 e 2 4

c Internal node n7 has child n2 and eliminates variable z6:
7 2 e 6

c Internal node n8 has children {n6, n7, n3} and eliminates variable z1:
8 6 7 3 e 1

c Internal node n9 has children {n4, n5} and eliminates variables {z3, z5}:
9 4 5 e 3 5

c Internal node n10 (root) has children {n8, n9} and eliminates no variable:
10 8 9 e

c This join tree is graded with grades I_X = {n8, n9, n10} and I_Y = {n6, n7}.
c Recall from file `./phi.cnf` that X = {z1, z3, z5} and Y = {z2, z4, z6}.
