	* Release version 0.99.2: Bugfix release

	* Fix parsing of 't' and 'f' in the extra info of acc-name headers, e.g.,
	     acc-name: undefined t
	  Previously, would lead to an infinite loop.

	* Fix dynamic_bitset::getHighestSetBit
	  Off-by-one error, tries to read potentially uninitialized
	  memory. This could lead to non-deterministic behavior for
	  getHighestSetBit, e.g., erroneous validation errors when
	  parsing when HOAIntermediateCheckValidity is active.

	* Add #include <stdexcept> to boolean_expression.hh to
	  have access to std::logical_error, even if not included by
	  the other standard library headers (fix compilation issue
	  with some older GCCs).
