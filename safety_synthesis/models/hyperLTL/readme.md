HyperLTL Benchmarks
===================

The benchmarks are approximations of HyperLTL model checking problems. Different implementations of standard protocols (AMBA, bakery, half-adders) are checked against certain symmetry properties.

Original specifications are in QBF with one quantifier alternation. The task of the synthesizer is to find a witness for the symmetry property. aag files in this directory were supplied by Markus Rabe, but some of them had 2 outputs instead of one. So we modified them using `aigor` to produce the files with exactly one output.
