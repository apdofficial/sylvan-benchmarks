New AMBA Benchmarks
====================

These are new variants of the AMBA benchmarks from SYNTCOMP 2014, for additional/larger parameters in two dimensions:

* the first number after `amba` gives the number of masters the circuit has to serve (now going up to `16`)

* the second number (after an additional letter `b`,`c` or `f`) gives the length/precision of the liveness-to-safety approximation. These are now included for much higher parameters, where before the parameters were (almost always) only the maximal that makes a benchmark still unrealizable, and the minimal that makes it realizable.
