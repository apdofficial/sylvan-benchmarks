HWMCC14 Benchmarks
==================

These benchmarks are based on a number of model checking benchmarks from
HWMCC14. All benchmarks are from the single safety property track, and are
originally unsafe.

They have been modified by making a subset of the inputs
controllable, which may or may not make them realizable. The controllable inputs
are also reflected in the file name, by appending "_c`i`to`j`" to the filename,
where inputs between `i` and `j` have been declared as controllable.
