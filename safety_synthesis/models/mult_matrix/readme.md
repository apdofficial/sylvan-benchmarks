Cycle Scheduler Benchmarks
==========================

These files specify a matrix multiplier --- the environment provides boolean matrices of size `m x n` and `n x o`, respectively, and the synthesizer has to supply the correct solution. For given `m`, `n`, `o`, the instance of the benchmark is contained in file `mult_bool_matrix_m_n_o.aag`.

The AIGER files for these benchmarks have been generated from an OCaml program that can be downloaded from the following address:
